# TextBlob

TextBlob is a Python (2 and 3) library for processing textual data.  
It provides a simple API for diving into common Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.

## Installation

Open Anaconda Prompt (or terminal) and enter the following command:

```python
pip install -U textblob
```

## Downloading Corpora

Natural Language Processing typically uses large bodies of linguistic data, or **corpora**.  
To download the necessary corpora, you can run the following command:

```python
python -m textblob.download_corpora
```
